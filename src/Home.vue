            perspective, which entails full-stack development using modern,

          In my personal projects, however, I often challenge myself to learning
          completely different areas, such as graphics rendering and physics
          simulation in a game programming context. I have working knowledge of
          industry-standard game engines Unity, Unreal and Godot, as well as
          graphics and physics middleware including OpenGL, PhysX and Bullet. I
          am familiar with many math concepts commonly used for rendering and
          lighting (algebra, vector math, calculus), as well as basic Newtonian
          dynamics required for physics and gameplay programming.
