        Due to programming being both my hobby and an integral part of my job, I

            My current professional background comes from a Web development
            perspective, which entails full-stack development using modern,
            open-source technologies, while also interfacing with
            proprietary/enterprise infrastructure to deliver services.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 pe-3">
            In my career, I have been responsible for not only developing new,
            innovative solutions, such as conversational chatbots and
            interactive navigation guides, but also maintaining legacy systems
            supporting key business operations and developing processes scalable
            to large volumes of data.

          I have working knowledge of industry-standard game engines Unity,
          Unreal and Godot, as well as graphics and physics middleware including
          OpenGL, PhysX and Bullet. I am familiar with many math concepts
          commonly used for rendering and lighting (algebra, vector math,
          calculus), as well as basic Newtonian dynamics required for physics
          and gameplay programming.
