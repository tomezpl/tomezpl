      <h1>Wide array of skills</h1>

        Due to programming being both my hobby and an integral part of my job, I
        have delved into a multitude of languages and domains.

            My current professional background comes from a Web development
            perspective, which entails full-stack development using modern,
            open-source technologies, while also interfacing with
            proprietary/enterprise infrastructure to deliver services.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 pe-3">
            In my career, I have been responsible for not only developing new, innovative solutions,
            such as conversational chatbots and interactive navigation guides, but also maintaining legacy systems supporting key business operations
            and developing processes scalable to large volumes of data.

        In my personal projects, however, I often challenge myself to learning
        completely different areas, such as graphics rendering and physics
        simulation in a game programming context.
