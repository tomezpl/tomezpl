    Hello! I am Tom and this is my blog - in short, I study Computer Science, 
    I do lots of programming and I'm an avid gamer. 
    I will be posting all kinds of articles - be it my reflections on the games industry, 
    programming concepts/ideas, perhaps even tutorials.

    This really just serves as an introduction - I appreciate you visiting my website 
    and I hope you check back from time to time!
