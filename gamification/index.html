                <p>
                    This is a proof-of-concept demo of a game that aims to aid in computer programming education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from that, it is also inspired by many popular video games based around puzzle solving.
                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                    The game is part of my undergraduate dissertation project at the University of Lincoln, UK.

                <h2>What is its purpose?</h2>
                <p>
                    The game will be used in a research experiment to assess the effectiveness of computer games as an auxiliary form of computer programming education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The research methodology involves a play session with the game's demo build (see: <a href="#instructions">Instructions</a>) and an <span style="font-weight: bold">anonymous</span> online survey.
