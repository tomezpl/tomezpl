					<h1>About me</h1>
					<h2>Brief</h2>
					<p>
						If you happen to have stumbled upon this page - welcome!
						My name is Tom, I'm currently a Computer Science student at University of Lincoln, UK. That is also my current workplace - I am part of the ICT department's associate developer team.
						Natively I am Polish, but I live in Britain and enjoy it here.

					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<p>
						My interests are... all over the place, really.
						Mainly it is game design &amp; development, graphics programming and computer architectures. In addition, at some point in the near future I plan on delving into how video editing software is built - and perhaps have a go at writing my own open-source editor.
